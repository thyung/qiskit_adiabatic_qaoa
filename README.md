## Overview
Simulate Adiabatic Process in Qiskit to solve a Max-Cut problem.  Alternatively, QAOA uses the same ansatz form to solve the same problem.

This is to demonstrate that QAOA ansatz is a reasonable guess due to Adiabatic Theorem.

## Content
1. [Chapter 1](01_adiabatic_process.ipynb) simulates Adiabatic Process to solve a Max-Cut problem.

2. [Chapter 2](02_qaoa.ipynb) uses QAOA to solve the same Max-Cut problem.

3. [Chapter 3](03_example_2.ipynb) shows Max-Cut of another graph.

## Notes
1. Qiskit 1.0.2 is required to run the jupyter notebooks because it uses EstimatorV2 and SamplerV2.
